# GeyserHighResolItem

Resolve the display issue of high-resolution items generated by Rainbow on the Bedrock Edition.

**Warning: For handheld items such as swords and axes, they will appear flat. I am trying to fix this issue, and if you have any repair methods, please feel free to PR.**

The item does not require Geyser's mapping, as it will automatically attempt to convert the item name into an identifier. 

If you find that the animation is not working correctly, please check if your item format is NAMESPACE.item/xxx. If not, you need to modify the script.
