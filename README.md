# GeyserHighResolItem

Resolve the display issue of high-resolution items generated by Rainbow on the Bedrock Edition.

**<s>Warning: For handheld items such as swords and axes, they will appear flat. I am trying to fix this issue, and if you have any repair methods, please feel free to PR.</s>**

This issue is been solved. but the animation is weird. you can modify animation file self.
